**Details**:

Developers can be confused about the READY option in Kanban. Does it mean the test case is new or returned after failing it?

**Answer:**

Developers must differentiate between the test case that failed and returned and the test case that is ready or new to test.  To differentiate this for the developer, you can split the READY option in Kanban into two categories:

**1.	Re-open:** Re-open option status will have failed test cases. 

**2.	Ready:** The Ready option should signify a new test case.

**Details**:

Kanban is used across industries like manufacturing and software.  Are Kanban cards physical or digital? Can you give examples of types of Kanban cards?

**Answer:**

Kanban cards can be digital or physical, although their function is the same regardless. It is more the industry or project context that leads to different types. For example, using Kanban cards for inventory in manufacturing and retail is common. A Kanban card may signal progress on a task, the kind of task or job, or who is responsible.

In manufacturing, Kanban cards can take several different types, for example:

**• Production Kanban cards:** A production Kanban card signals the beginning of production. They are also used to track components needed for production. They can show quantities and the quality of work required.  
**•	Withdrawal Kanban cards:** These kinds of cards signal that work is completed in an area, needs to move on to the next, and that a team is ready to work on the next item.  
**•	Supplier Kanban cards:** These keep track of suppliers, their contact details, and the type of communications they need to receive.  

In the software industry, Kanban cards facilitate continuous delivery. This is where teams deliver small, frequent updates on a rapid release cycle rather than letting bug fixes and features accumulate into big launches.

## How do you measure team performance in Kanban?

**Details**:

Let's assume I decide to manage a particular project using Kanban.  I want to measure the team's performance, but I have never used Kanban.

Would adding story points to each task on the board before starting development, as in Scrum, help in measuring team performance?


**Answer:**

Adding story points helps to determine the level of difficulty of the task. More specific performance measurements are:  

  **•	Throughput:** Amount of items done in some period (5 backlog items per week or 3 features per quarter, for example)  
  **•	Cycle time:** The time it takes from the start of work until delivery  
  **•	Lead time:** Time from when a need is identified until it is delivered  
  **•	Escaped defects:** Number of bugs that slip past the team  
  **•	Value delivered:** Like throughput, but measured in some value units realized instead of work items done
